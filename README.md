moodfor is an app that recommends movies based on how you are feeling. Rather than rely on regular search terms (genre, year, actors, etc), or long reviews that paint the film in whatever light the writer sees fit, moodfor uses an algorithm that makes recommendations based on your current mood, or the mood you want to be in.

moodfor was built using Ruby on Rails. Javascript and Jquery were employed to call the API. Data was pulled from themoviedb.org, who were kind enough to provide an API key. Materialize CSS aided in the sleek design. The following gems were helpful in the development of the app:

	-JSON
	-gon
	-rmagick
	-better_errors
	-binding_of_caller
	-pry rails

moodfor is in alpha at the moment. More functionalities are on their way.
